//  ManifestDonor — contributes manifest request codes for depots this
//  account owns.
//
//  The backend mints codes from its own Steam sessions, but that only
//  reaches depots those sessions can access; anything else answers 403.
//  This closes that gap by minting from a signed-in user who owns the
//  depot, on request.
//
//  Sits opposite ManifestClient, which *consumes* codes from the same
//  service. Nothing here feeds the local Steam client.
//
//  Direction matters: the server sends what it wants first, and the
//  client answers only with the intersection it owns. The user's library
//  is never uploaded.
//
//  Codes are bound to (depot, manifest) and rotate a few minutes after
//  issuance, so they are minted on demand and posted immediately — there
//  is no store-and-forward, and a stored code would simply be dead.

    // traffic — the code was already spent on a real download. Posts on a
    // detached worker; a no-op when [donate] is disabled or any argument is 0.

    // batching.
